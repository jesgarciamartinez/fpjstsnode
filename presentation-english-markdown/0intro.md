# Functional programming with Typescript

## Why functional programming

### What properties do we want our software to have?

- Correctness
  The software does what it's supposed to do, i.e., reflects its _design_
- Flexibility
  The software is easy to modify as the design (requirements) change

### So why functional programming

- Make design explicit with types
- Compositionality
